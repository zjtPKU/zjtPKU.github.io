Hello! My name is Juntin Zhou, and I am currently a third-year student at Peking University. My academic focus lies in the fields of Bioinformatics and Large Language Models (LLM). I am passionate about integrating computational techniques with biological data to uncover new insights and advancements in healthcare. Additionally, I am intrigued by the development and application of large language models, exploring their potential to revolutionize various domains through advanced natural language processing.

I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to contributing to these dynamic and evolving fields.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me.
