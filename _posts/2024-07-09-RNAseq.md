## Introduction
This semester, I took Professor Li's course on Genomic Data Analysis, where an important part was learning RNAseq-related analytical techniques. The term project required us to conduct an omics study using the techniques learned during the semester. I am deeply grateful to Professor Wang Shiqiang from the School of Life Sciences and Senior Xu Haoyang, who generously provided the raw data! This article will briefly introduce the project background and then include the original text. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
